# Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Galois Fields Lab
Welcome to my Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Galois Fields Lab! This project explores the implementation of the extended Euclidean algorithm and the use of Galois Fields.

## Overview
This lab investigates the mathematical method of the extended Euclidean algorithm using Matlab. The extended Euclidean algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and expressing it as a linear combination of those integers. This algorithm has wide applications in number theory, cryptography, and coding theory.

> Additionally, the lab includes the implementation of Galois Fields, also known as finite fields. Galois Fields are essential in various areas, including error detection and correction, cryptography, and digital signal processing. They provide a structured way to handle arithmetic operations in a finite set of elements, making them crucial for efficient computations in these fields.
